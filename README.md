# .NET_BlogAPI

A CRUD API for a blog solution that is made with .NET.

This backend solution can be used in a full-fletched blog-like application be it on the web or on the phone.

Testing is work-in-progress. I need to complete the tests.

Technologies used:
* .NET 6
* Entity Framework Core
* PostgreSQL
* FluentValidation
* Netwonsoft.JSON
* AutoMapper
* Moq (**testing**)
* Bogus (**testing**)
* xUnit (**testing**)

PostgreSQL container is containerized with docker-compose.
